# Goal & Aims
This Do-it-Yourself (DIY) course is designed to provide a basic grounding of the Internet of Things (IoT).

* The aim is to equip students with the Data Science skills in order to complete basic IoT-scenario's. 
* Providing students with templates and a data-toolkit (code), which can be implemented through popular single board microcontrollers (Arduino / Raspberry Pi).
* Use of Generative AI [Gen-AI] such as Co-Pilot or ChatGPT is encouraged. It's important to make sure that other people are aware that these technologies were used. This can be done by including references or citations in the code or documentation, or by making a statement in the README file or other documentation that the project relies on these technologies. Additionally, it's also a good practice to include information about the limitations and potential biases of the technology in the documentation or code comments.


# Required Hardware

# Learning objectives
* Become familiar with Data Science concepts surrounding IoT applications
* Prepare a (Rapid) prototype for an Internet of Things (IoT) data-pipeline scenario's
* Learn to design and develop simple lightweight IoT-prototypes
* Learn to report on IoT projects (inclusive prototypes + data-pipelines).

>This course teaches you the basics of electronics and
GPIO interfacing with Python. You will build and experiment with simple electronic
circuits that are controlled using Python, and combine this learning to build a simple yet
complete internet-controllable IoT application with aid of Data Science concepts and IoT middle-ware such as Thingspeak and dweet.io.
